Use this at your own risk. Doing so will mean a GPT provider's telemetry data will have your sob story. 

If you are cautious enough, this could work out for you.

:::warning

Do not include identifying information in the prompt. Do not share legal, medical, personal, or financial information. 

Your objective is to understand your own blindspots and the stories you are telling yourself. Don't give GPT anything more than necessary. 

Do not develop attachments to the GPT. The GPT is not your friend nor can it be attached to you. You are using it to trauma dump because maybe you are not lucky enough to have someone as an outlet or you want to let your BFF have a rest day.

1. **Commit to executing, not just thinking**. Set a clear financial and creative strategy—stop treating money as a side quest.
2. **Stop assuming you’re a burden in relationships**. If you want a partner, show up as an asset, not as someone waiting to be "chosen."
3. **Play the long game strategically**. You don’t have to sell out, but you do have to be smart about positioning yourself.
4. **Create with purpose, not just for self-satisfaction**. If you want your work to be timeless, make sure it actually impacts people.
5. **Start taking up space**. Don’t retreat just because things aren’t easy. If you want people to recognize your value, show up as valuable.
